I have got news for you about nginx.
</para>

<para>
Recently it became very clear for me that because of increasing
popularity of nginx and the volume of work required to develop
the code and doing support, I really need to put it at another level.
</para>

<para>
So, I have decided to focus even more on nginx and established
nginx as a company to fully dedicate myself to the project. I am not alone,
there are a few nice people working for me on this. I am focusing
on the development part, and to some extent on the company operations as well.
</para>

<para>
Our primary goals are improving support and communication for our users,
streamlining the development process, revamping the documentation,
integrating and speeding up pending bugfixes and patches, introducing
long-requested functionality and more.
</para>

<para>
It should be noted that nginx will remain free, open-source software
under 2-clause BSD license. There will be no shortage of new and
long-awaited features too.
</para>

<para>
Thank you very much for your ongoing support through all these years.
Without your awareness, feedback and support nginx would not become
that successful.
I am really looking forward to see more people who found nginx useful.
I am also very glad we now have a proper way of doing a lot more for you.
</para>

<para>
Thanks!<br/>
Igor Sysoev

W3Techs reports that

use nginx. Hence nginx is on the 3rd place after Apache (70.2%) and IIS (20.5%).

By the way, Netcraft reports similar

Another survey by BuiltWith.com.
It&rsquo;s interesting that nginx is used rather on more loaded sites:
<link url="http://trends.builtwith.com/Web%20Server/nginx">4.95%
of the top 10,000 sites versus 3.14% of the top million</link>
(on July 27, 2010),
while Apache is used more on less loaded sites:
<link url="http://trends.builtwith.com/Web-Server/Apache">63.60%
of the top million sites versus 55.79% of the top 10,000 sites</link>.
IIS/6.0 is more preferred on middle range sites:
<link url="http://trends.builtwith.com/Web-Server/IIS-6">24.49%
of the top 100,000 sites versus 20.05% of the top 10,000
